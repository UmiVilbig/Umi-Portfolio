# Umi Portfolio

This project was created to showcase my skills as a software developer. I used Sanity for the backend and React for the frontend.
## Lessons Learned

## Features

- Slick in motions for divs and components
- Connecting frontend React to backend Sanity
- Sorting by Tags for the Works section
